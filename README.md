This project explores the Newton-Raphson iterative root-finding method, particularly its chaotic behaviour in the complex plane.

The Newton-Raphson algorithm is a bit like playing 'Marco Polo' with a maths function; You pick a starting point, shout the algorithm, and the maths tells you which point to move to next. As this process is repeated, each new starting point should be nearer and nearer to where the expression equals zero. Of course, many functions have multiple zeroes, and where you land depends on where you started.
